The V60 is a coffee dripper, and it's one of the most popular manual brewing methods. The V60 is a cone-shaped device with a single large hole, spiraling ridges along the inside, and a large opening at the bottom. The V60 is a pour-over method, meaning you pour hot water over the grounds to extract the coffee flavors into your cup or serving vessel below.
